##<h1>MDS Tech: Calendar Assignment</h1>

##The Assignment

Create a small app that fetches South African public holidays for a year and displays them on a page:

Guidelines:

- Use Laravel 7 for the back-end.
- Use Bootstrap 4 for the front-end.
- Fetch from http://kayaposoft.com/enrico.
- Store it in the database.
- Fetch the data via a console job.
- Add a link to download the holiday list as a pdf.
- Create unit tests for the console job.
- Use git with clear commits. 

## Additional preferences
Clean code and inventiveness are valued.

## App Information
The application has two views. 
The first view displays a calendar that contains all the months of the year. 
All the holidays will be displayed where applicable.
The second view generates a printable Pdf file which also displays the months of the year with all the holidays displayed.

In order to populate the database with the necessary data (holidays) you will need to run the custom console command ``` holidays:fetch ``` in your terminal.

Once the command has been run you can visit the calendar page which is set as the web application's homepage ``` URI = '/' ```.

The site is responsive and makes use of a myriad of bootstrap 4's features.

Thank you for taking the time to view my application. I aim to impress and hopefully make your short-list. 

Best of luck
